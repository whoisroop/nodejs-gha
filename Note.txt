The workflow file consists of:

name: <Name Of WorkFlow>
on: <Trigger>
jobs:
    <JOB NAME>:
        runs-on: <Runner>
        steps:
            - name: <STEP NAME>
              run: <Command>


Workflow triggers, apart from repository related (push, pull-requests, ...):
1. workflow_dispatch: Manual Trigger
2. repository_dispatch: API Trigger
3. schedule: Runs On Schedule Basis
4. workflow_call: Triggered By Another Workflow

Expression & Context Objects:
Context objects: A context object is a special variable GitHub makes available inside workflows. They hold information about the workflow, runner, jobs, events, and even secrets.
The rendering of the context object / expressions occurs prior execution.

Example:- jobs.steps.run = echo "${{ github }}"
The actions controller, 

github, secrets, env, needs, runner, matrix, Condition if: always(), success() / failure() 

GitHub Actions Output & Environment:
echo "color=YELLOW" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
run: echo "${{ steps.<STEP NAME>.outputs.color }}"

echo "MYTOKEN=xxx" >> $GITHUB_ENV

Purpose: prepend directories to PATH for subsequent steps.
echo "/opt/mytool/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
